    <h3>Equipment List</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A mug</li>
        <li>Straw, known as bombilla</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions for hot Yerba Mate</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Fill a cup about ⅓ full of loose yerba mate leaf.</li>
        <li>Fill a cup about ⅓ full of loose yerba mate leaf. </li>
        <li>Next, tilt the cup until all the yerba is leaning against one side of the cup and fill the vacant space with cold water. The yerba will begin to soak up the water.</li>
        <li>Once the cool water has been absorbed, fill the cup with hot water, but not too hot, around 70-80 degrees celsius. If you don’t want to use a thermometer, stop the kettle boiling before it bubbles or open the kettle for 5 minutes after it has stopped boiling, to allow the water to cool.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Directions for hot Yerba Mate</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Although yerba mate is most commonly drunk hot, it can also be consumed cold. </li>
        <li>To do this, replace the hot water with cold water. This method of preparation is called ‘Terere’ and is common in Paraguay.</li>
        <li>If you are without a Gourd and Bombilla, this form of yerba mate can also be brewed in a french press. Just put the mate where you would usually put the ground coffee and use it as normal. This is a much easier way to enjoy loose leaf yerba mate. </li>
        <li>Or if yerba mate just isn’t for you, replace the tea leaves with desiccated coconut, and water with milk to create a delicious warming drink, perfect for sweet lovers and kids. </li>
        </ul>
